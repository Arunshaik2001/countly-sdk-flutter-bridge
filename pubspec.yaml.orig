  # Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications platform. 
  # It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. 
  # There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data. 
  # Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.
